#### QUIC

  QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections, pronounced quick) is an experimental transport layer network protocol developed by Google. QUIC supports a set of multiplexed connections between two endpoints over User Datagram Protocol (UDP), and was designed to provide security protection equivalent to TLS/SSL, along with reduced connection and transport latency, and bandwidth estimation in each direction to avoid congestion. QUIC's main goal is to optimize connection-oriented web applications currently using TCP. An experimental implementation is being put in place in Chrome by a team of engineers at Google.

#### VP8


#### H.264


#### WebM

#### Dash

  Unlike HLS, HDS, and Smooth Streaming, DASH is codec-agnostic,
  which means it can use content encoded with any coding format like H.265, H.264, VP9 etc.
